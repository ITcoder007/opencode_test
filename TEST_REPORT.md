# Test Report

## Test Execution: HelloTest.java

**Date:** 2026-05-21
**Iteration:** TC1_2 conversion (15/15 passed)
**Status:** ALL TESTS PASSED

### Summary

- Total: 15
- Passed: 15
- Failed: 0

### Basic Structure Tests

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Hello class exists and can be loaded | PASS |
| Class is named 'Hello' | PASS |
| Hello class is public | PASS |
| Hello has a main method | PASS |
| main method is public static void with String[] param | PASS |

### Output Correctness Tests

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| main() outputs 'Hello, World!' | PASS |
| Java output matches Python print('Hello, World!') output | PASS |
| Output ends with system newline (matches println behavior) | PASS |
| Output has no leading whitespace | PASS |
| No trailing spaces before newline | PASS |
| Exact output is 'Hello, World!' + newline | PASS |

### Robustness Tests

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| main() handles null args without crashing | PASS |
| main() ignores extra arguments gracefully | PASS |
| Running main() twice produces identical output | PASS |
| Output is exactly one line | PASS |

### Verification Steps

1. Compiled with `javac -encoding UTF-8 Hello.java HelloTest.java` - SUCCESS
2. Ran Python baseline: `python3 hello.py` -> `Hello, World!`
3. Ran Java: `java Hello` -> `Hello, World!`
4. Diff comparison: identical output (exit code 0)
5. Ran full test suite: `java HelloTest` -> 15/15 PASSED

### Conclusion

The Java conversion of `hello.py` to `Hello.java` is verified correct. All structural, output, and robustness tests pass.

## End-to-End Acceptance Verification

**Date:** 2026-05-21
**Environment:** macOS, JDK 22.0.2, Python 3.12.11
**Status:** ACCEPTED

### Verification Protocol

1. **Environment Check** - javac 22.0.2, java 22.0.2, python3 3.12.11
2. **Python Baseline** - `python3 hello.py` -> `Hello, World!` (exit 0)
3. **Java Compilation** - `javac -encoding UTF-8 Hello.java HelloTest.java` (exit 0)
4. **Java Execution** - `java Hello` -> `Hello, World!` (exit 0)
5. **Output Comparison** - `diff` between Python and Java output: identical (exit 0)
6. **Test Suite** - `java HelloTest` -> 15/15 PASSED (exit 0)

### Results

| Verification Step | Result |
|-------------------|--------|
| Java environment available | PASS |
| Python baseline captured | PASS |
| Java compilation succeeds | PASS |
| Java output matches Python | PASS |
| All 15 unit tests pass | PASS |

### Final Verdict

**ACCEPTED** - The Python-to-Java conversion of `hello.py` to `Hello.java` passes all end-to-end acceptance criteria. The converted Java code compiles cleanly, produces identical output to the Python source, and passes all 15 structural/output/robustness tests.
